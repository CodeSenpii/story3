<p>Every day I wake up, the first thing I do is pull the curtains back and open
the window. The fresh morning breezing enters my room replacing the stale air.
Along with the fresh breeze comes the songs of singing birds and barking dogs.</p>

<p>For a few moments I stand in the window and inhale the fresh morning scents of
flowers and dew drops. The dew drops leave a silvery lining on each blade of
grass that sparkles in the morning sun like tiny diamonds; each twinkle lulls me into a trance.</p>

<p>In an instance I am lifted from my dreamlike state as the hint of breakfast fills
my nostrils. Eggs, bacons, toast?  I wonder what’s on the menu this morning? First,
I attend to my morning chores. I make my bed, nice and neat with not a single wrinkle.</p>

<p>Then, I go outside and wash my father’s car. Washing the car everyday was important to
my dad because we lived close to the ocean. The salty air of the ocean wreak havoc with
anything made of metal.</p>

<p>Once I get done with my chores, I get ready for school. In my school we wear uniforms.
The Boys wear short kakis pants with a blue shirt and the girls wear blue skirts with
a white blouse. After all the chores and morning routines are done,</p>

 <p>I finally get to eat breakfast.</p>

 <p>School</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast my dad takes me to school. I usually get to school early before
the bell rings. Some of my friends also make it in early to the school yard. We would play
all kinds of games before school starts.</p>

<p>Our favorite morning game is cricket. I love playing with my friends. We play and play until
the bell rings. Once school is in session the day goes by slowly. The only saving grace is
lunch break. I attend a Christian denominated primary school.</p>

<p>A typical school day starts with morning assembly where we repeat the national anthem and some
prayers. After assembly we go to our home room where we take all our classes. I don’t have a
favorite subject in school and I am just an average student.</p>

<p>Some of my school mates are really sharp, they answer all the questions. Sometimes the teacher
calls on me for answers. I try my best to give a good answer. If I don’t know the answer I just
say “I have no idea”.</p>

<p>The rest of the class laughs at me and I am good with that. Some of my class mates thinks that
I am very funny. However, the teacher never laughs at my in-class antics.  Lunch time is my
favorite part of the school day, it’s also the</p>

<p>hottest time of the day but that doesn’t stop us from playing. We play so hard that we get soaked
in our own sweat. Fifteen minutes before lunch is over the boys in the group take off their soaking
wet shirts and hang them on the</p>

<p>school fence to dry. After lunch is over, we head back to the home room where we complete the day.
When the last bell rings to end the school day we all rise and sing a modified version of the end
of day hymnal “Now the day is over…”.</p>

<p>School’s out</p>

<p>On some days after school lets out, I attend after school classes where we practice handwriting,
spelling and math. The tutor is very strict and does not mess about. You must be on your best
behavior during after school classes. Participation is</p>

<p>made mandatory along with homework and the consequence for not doing your homework is steep.
On the days I have extra classes my dad picks me up. On day I don’t have extra classes I choose
to walk home with my friends.</p>

<p>Walking home from school is by far the best part of my day. I estimate the walk to my home to be
about 3 miles; 3 whole miles of fun and tomfoolery with friends. Climbing fruit trees, chasing
stray dogs, and playing with fish</p>

<p>found in the nearby streams. As we reached the home of one of our traveling companions, we say
our goodbyes and the rest of the group moves on. My house is the last stop and when I get there,
I am very tired.</p>

<p>School nights</p>

<p>Once I get home there are things I must attend too. After I take a few moments to rest I would
feed my pet dog, wet the flower pots and vegetable garden and complete any homework. After all
my work is done, we have dinner.</p>

<p>At the kitchen table my family says grace, eat and chat about our day. This is usually the time I
get to hear my parents talk about any complaints or praise I get from my teachers. But most times
it’s “no news” from school.</p>

<p>After dinner I prepare for bed and say my goodnights to my mom and dad and it’s off to la-la land
for me. I close my eyes and think about what I would like to dream of. My favorite dreams are the
ones where i'm flying...Z Z Z Z Z.</p>

<p>The End</p>
